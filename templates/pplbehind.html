                <h1>President</h1>
                <h3>Zhaniya Rakhimova</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the KIMEP Research Club! I am eager to share with you the purpose of our organization and my own personal journey. 
                    I am Zhaniya Rakhimova, a third-year student at KIMEP University, pursuing a degree in international affairs and global security. 
                    I am currently serving as the president of the KIMEP Research Club, an organization I co-founded. <br>
                    Our objective has consistently been cultivating a supportive environment where students can enhance their research and writing abilities. 
                    We believe that strong academic writing skills are crucial for success in any subject, especially if you want to connect your life with science. 
                    To this end, we endeavor to assist our members in developing their ideas, conducting in-depth research, and effectively presenting their findings 
                    through workshops, peer reviews, and research conferences. <br>
                    The activities of our group are most effectively represented by our student journal- ‚ÄúNovaPro‚Äù. It serves as a forum for the expression of our members' 
                    dedication and creative ideas. Our club's broad interests and areas of expertise are reflected in the wide variety of topics covered by the articles 
                    we publish each semester. This magazine is more than a mere publication; it is evidence of our members' commitment and intellectual curiosity.
                    <br>
                    Russia and Central Asia represent my own personal research interest, with a particular emphasis on the foreign policy of the Central Asian governments. 
                    My membership in the KIMEP Research Club and the majority of my academic work have been motivated by this regional focus. I believe that anyone studying 
                    international affairs in the present era must possess a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of this strategically significant region.
                    <br>
                    Moreover, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to study as an exchange student at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea from September 
                    2023 to December 2023. My perspective was broadened and my awareness of global concerns was deepened by this experience. It also reaffirmed my resolve 
                    to support our club's mission of encouraging global cooperation and academic success.
                    <br>
                    In my capacity as president of the KIMEP Research Club, I am committed to providing our members with the resources and motivation they need to 
                    achieve success. This is a friendly and intellectually interesting group, regardless of one's area of passion: international relations, political 
                    science, economics, etc.
                    I would be delighted if you would consider joining us in developing your research abilities. By working together, we may have a significant effect 
                    and contribute to the accumulation of knowledge in our respective professions. Welcome to the KIMEP Research Club!

                <h3>Gulnur Adanbekova</h3>
                <p>Hi! My name is Gulnur, and I am vice president of KRC and head of the IT department. If you are having any trouble with this website, this is probably my fault. 
                    Sorry for that :). I am currently majoring in Information Systems in Business, specifically big data analytics, and have discovered at KIMEP my passion for research 
                    and writing. <br><br> My personal research interests are all connected to statistical methods, data management, and artificial intelligence. They led me to co-found the organization 
                    with Zhaniya. We hope to create a supportive and creative research writing community among students at our university, as well as provide a way for feedback and publishing 
                    of the works in NovaPro. In our organization, we collaborate on writing projects and organize events with guest lecturers, as our goal is continuous self-improvement. I hope 
                    very much to see ambitious, inspiring people join us to grow to our full potential together!¬†</p>

                    Editorial and writing departments are basing our magazine. Editorial department consists of one or two people that search not always interesting works, at the same time writing department is the most curious for me, I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in charge there, or because it‚Äôs really interesting. The writing department writes. When an interesting piece of work appears in our magazine, most likely it is the work of the writing department, which consists of four people, talented and inspired, but they don‚Äôt write in Russian (I don‚Äôt know why). Before each issue of the magazine, we all get together and discuss the topics of work, this process is tedious and long. My place in this matter is fundamentally no different from ordinary participants; the dominant position only forces me to engage in formal organizational work. But, nevertheless, without me they would not have organized themselves, so what you are reading here would not have happened without me.
